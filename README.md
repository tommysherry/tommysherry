Hey everyone, my name is Tommy Sherry (@tommysherry). 
I'm a newbie to coding, and am interested in web development.  As of now more interested in front end, but to become a full stack developer definetly sounds interesting. 
I graduated college in 2017 with a B.A. in Political Science and Public Law, and have been in the legal field ever since.  
I am looking to pivot out of the legal field into a space that I find interesting and fulfilling.
I am currently learning HTML, CSS & JavaScript through Udemy's Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp, and so far I absolutely love it (albeit it hasn't gotten too difficult yet).
